                    <p>In our first JavaScript module, we first answer some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it
                    look like?", and "what can it do?", before moving on to taking you through your first practical experience of writing
                    JavaScript. After that, we discuss some key building blocks in detail, such as variables, strings, numbers and arrays.</p>
                    <p>Before starting this module, you don't need any previous JavaScript knowledge, but you should have some familiarity
                    with HTML and CSS.</p>

                    <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and Python.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Fr端h (which means "early" in
                    German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
                    <code>var Fr端h = "foobar";</code>
                    <p>But, the variable fr端h is not the same as Fr端h because JavaScript is case sensitive.
                    
                    In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>

                    <p>The let statement declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value. let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is
                    used. This is unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of
                    block scope.</p>
                    <code>let x = 1;</code>

                <article>
                    <p>A conditional statement is a set of commands that executes if a specified condition is true. JavaScript supports two
                    conditional statements: if...else and switch.</p>
                    <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a
                    statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
                    <code>if (condition) {
                    statement_1;
                    } else {
                    statement_2;
                    }</code>
                    <p>Here the condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what
                    evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, <code>statement_1</code> is executed; otherwise, <code>statement_2</code> is
                    executed.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>A <code>for</code> loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C
                    <code>for</code> loop. A <code>for</code> statement looks as follows:</p>
                    <code>for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression])
                    statement</code>
                    <p>When a <code>for</code> loop executes, the following occurs:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more
                            loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare
                            variables.</li>
                            <li>The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. If the value of
                            condition is false, the for loop terminates. If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed
                            to be true.</li>
                            <li> statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
                            If present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed.</li>
                            <li> returns to step 2.</li>
                            <li>Lorem ipsum.</li>
                        </ol>
                </article>            
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="do_while_statement">
            <header>do while statement</header>
                <article>
                    <p>The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. A do...while statement looks as
                    follows:</p>
                    <code>do
                    statement
                    while (condition);</code>
                    <p>statement is always executed once before the condition is checked (and then again until the while condition returns
                    false). To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements. If condition is
                    true, the statement executes again. At the end of every execution, the condition is checked. When the condition is
                    false, execution stops and control passes to the statement following do...while.</p>
